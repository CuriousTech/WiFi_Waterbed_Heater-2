WiFi Waterbed heater with touchscreen  

A waterbed heater with a 2.4" Nextion HMI touchscreen, speaker and PIR sensor for more fuctionality than the first one. This has a large display for an alarm clock. The PIR sensor turns on the display as well as 2 WiFi dimmers. The smaller speaker inside is used for the alarm, touch clicks and accepts external command (used for doorbell). The rest of the code was taken from the older version.
